## Wildlife Detection and Tracking

We've taken the challenge of detecting and tracking wildlife animals, specifically: wild boars, using thermal vison, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and machine learning. 

### Vision

- TBD

### Dataset

It is possible to get enough data without costly UAV flights. We generate synthetic data using [Arma 3](https://arma3.com/) tactical simulator, imitating very closely real conditions in the field. Such approaches were successfully applied to autonomous driving problems. You can see the results of our synthesis right now -- it's the animated background.
