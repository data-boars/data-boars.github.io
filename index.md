## Wildlife Detection and Tracking

We've taken the challenge of detecting and tracking wildlife animals, specifically: wild boars, using thermal vison, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and machine learning. 

### Vision

We seek for composition of methods solving the following tasks:
- Detection -- wild animals should be detected
- Classification -- animals should be recognized and classified, e.g. is this a boar, or a deer?
- Tracking -- animals should be trackable, i.e. system operators should be able to track paths of animals of interest
- Counting -- the system should be able to count animals it encounters

### Dataset

It is possible to get enough data without costly UAV flights. We generate synthetic data using [Arma 3](https://arma3.com/) tactical simulator, imitating very closely real conditions in the field. Such approaches were successfully applied to autonomous driving problems. You can see the results of our synthesis right now -- it's the animated background.
